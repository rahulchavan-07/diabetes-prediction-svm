# Diabetes Prediction using SVM

This project builds a machine learning model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict whether a person is diabetic based on medical attributes. It uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a simple prediction interface.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: [PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Attributes**:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age
  - Outcome (0: Non-diabetic, 1: Diabetic)

## ðŸ§  Model Used
